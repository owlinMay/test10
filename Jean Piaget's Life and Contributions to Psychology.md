Jean Piaget's Life and Contributions to Psychology
==================================================

Jean Piaget was a Swiss psychologist and genetic epistemologist. He is most famously known for his theory of cognitive development that looked at [how children develop intellectually](https://www.verywellmind.com/child-development-theories-2795068) throughout the course of childhood.

皮亚杰是瑞士心理学家和遗传学认识论专家。他最著名的是他的认知发展理论，该理论研究儿童在整个童年时期的智力发展。

Overview of Piaget's Life and Work 皮亚杰生平事迹综述
--------------------------------------------

Prior to Piaget's theory, children were often thought of simply as mini-adults.1 Instead, Piaget suggested that the way children think is fundamentally different from the way that adults think.

在皮亚杰的理论出现之前，人们通常认为孩子是迷你成年人。皮亚杰认为，孩子的思考方式与成年人的思考方式有着根本的不同。

Piaget's theory had a tremendous influence on the emergence of [developmental psychology](https://www.verywellmind.com/developmental-psychology-overview-4581790) as a distinctive subfield within psychology and contributed greatly to the field of education. He is also credited as a pioneer of the [constructivist theory](https://www.verywellmind.com/constructivism-and-psychotherapy-2337730), which suggests that people actively construct their knowledge of the world based on the interaction between their ideas and experiences.

皮亚杰的理论对发展心理学作为心理学中一个独特的分支领域的出现产生了巨大的影响，并对教育领域做出了巨大的贡献。他还被认为是建构主义理论的先驱，建构主义理论认为，人们积极地建构他们对世界的认识，是基于他们的想法和经验之间的相互作用。

In a 2002 survey of 1,725 American Psychological Society members, Piaget was named the second [most influential psychologist](https://www.verywellmind.com/most-influential-psychologists-2795264) of the 20th century.2

在2002年对1725名美国心理学会会员的调查中，皮亚杰被评为20世纪第二有影响力的心理学家

Piaget's Early Life 皮亚杰的早年生活
----------------------------

Jean Piaget was born in Switzerland on August 9, 1896, and began showing an interest in the natural sciences at a very early age. By the time he was 11, he had already started his career as a researcher by writing a short paper on an albino sparrow.

让 · 皮亚杰1896年8月9日出生于瑞士，很小的时候就对自然科学产生了兴趣。在他11岁的时候，他已经开始了他的研究生涯，写了一篇关于白化病麻雀的短篇论文。

Piaget continued to study the natural sciences and received his Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Neuchâtel in 1918. It was during this time that he published two essays that provided a foundation for his future thoughts and theories.

皮亚杰继续学习自然科学，并于1918年获得纳沙泰尔大学动物学博士学位。正是在这期间，他发表了两篇文章，为他未来的思想和理论奠定了基础。

Piaget's Career and Theories 皮亚杰的职业生涯与理论
----------------------------------------

Piaget had several ideas or theories about cognitive development throughout his career, some of which are outlined below.

皮亚杰在他的整个职业生涯中有几个关于认知发展的想法或理论，其中一些概述如下。

### Intellectual Development 智力发展

Piaget developed an interest in psychoanalysis and spent a year working at a boys' institution created by [Alfred Binet](https://www.verywellmind.com/alfred-binet-biography-2795503). Binet is known as the developer of the world's first intelligence test and Piaget took part in scoring these assessments.

皮亚杰对精神分析产生了兴趣，并在阿尔弗雷德 · 比奈创立的一家男童机构工作了一年。比奈是世界上第一个智力测验的开发者，皮亚杰参与了这些测验的评分工作。

While his early career consisted of work in the natural sciences, it was during the 1920s that he began to move toward work as a psychologist. He married Valentine Châtenay in 1923 and the couple went on to have three children. It was Piaget's observations of his own children that served as the basis for many of his later theories.

虽然他早期的职业生涯包括自然科学方面的工作，但是在20世纪20年代，他开始转向心理学家的工作。1923年，他与瓦伦丁 · 沙特内结婚，并育有三个孩子。正是皮亚杰对自己孩子的观察，构成了他后来许多理论的基础。

### Roots of Knowledge 知识的根源

Piaget identified himself as a genetic epistemologist. In his paper _Genetic Epistemology,_ Piaget explained, "What the genetic epistemology proposes is discovering the roots of the different varieties of knowledge, since its elementary forms, following to the next levels, including also the scientific knowledge."3

皮亚杰认为自己是一个遗传学认识论专家。皮亚杰在他的论文《发生认识论》中解释说: “发生认识论提出的是发现不同知识种类的根源，因为它的基本形式，随后到下一个层次，包括科学知识。“3

Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that is concerned with the origin, nature, extent, and limits of human knowledge. Piaget was interested not only in the nature of thought but also in how it develops and how genetics impact this process.

认识论是关于人类知识的起源、性质、范围和限度的哲学分支。皮亚杰不仅对思想的本质感兴趣，而且还对思想如何发展以及遗传学如何影响这一过程感兴趣。

His early work with Binet's [intelligence tests](https://www.verywellmind.com/history-of-intelligence-testing-2795581) led Piaget to conclude that children think differently than adults. While this is a widely accepted notion today, it was considered revolutionary at the time. It was this observation that inspired his interest in understanding how knowledge grows throughout childhood.

他早期对比奈智力测验的研究使皮亚杰得出结论，认为儿童的思维方式与成人不同。虽然这在今天是一个被广泛接受的概念，但在当时却被认为是革命性的。正是这一发现激发了他对理解知识在童年时期是如何成长的兴趣。

### Schemas 图式

Piaget suggested that children sort the knowledge they acquire through their experiences and interactions into groupings known as [schemas](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-schema-2795873). When new information is acquired, it can either be [assimilated](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-assimilation-2794821) into existing schemas or [accommodated](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-accommodation-2795218) through revising an existing schema or creating an entirely new category of information.4

皮亚杰认为，孩子们把他们通过经历和互动获得的知识分成一组，称为图式。当获得新的信息时，可以将其吸收到现有的模式中，也可以通过修改现有的模式或创建一个全新的信息类别来适应它

Today, Piaget is best known for his research on children's cognitive development. Piaget studied the intellectual development of his own three children and created a theory that described the stages that children pass through in the development of intelligence and formal thought processes.

今天，皮亚杰最著名的是他对儿童认知发展的研究。皮亚杰研究了他自己的三个孩子的智力发展，并创立了一个理论，描述了孩子在智力发展和形式思维过程中所经历的阶段。

### Stages of Cognitive Development 认知发展阶段

Piaget's theory identifies four stages:4

皮亚杰的理论分为四个阶段:

(1) [The sensorimotor stage](https://www.verywellmind.com/sensorimotor-stage-of-cognitive-development-2795462): The first stage of development lasts from birth to approximately age 2. At this point in development, children know the world primarily through their senses and motor movements.

(1)感觉运动阶段: 发育的第一阶段从出生到2岁左右。在这个发展阶段，孩子们主要通过他们的感官和动作来了解这个世界。

(2) [The preoperational stage](https://www.verywellmind.com/preoperational-stage-of-cognitive-development-2795461): The second stage of development lasts from the ages of 2 to 7 and is characterized by the development of language and the emergence of symbolic play.

运作前阶段: 第二阶段的发展从2岁持续到7岁，拥有属性是语言的发展和符号游戏的出现。

(3) [The concrete operational stage](https://www.verywellmind.com/concrete-operational-stage-of-cognitive-development-2795458): The third stage of cognitive development lasts from the age of 7 to approximately age 11. At this point, logical thought emerges but children still struggle with abstract and theoretical thinking.

(3)具体操作阶段: 认知发展的第三阶段从7岁持续到11岁左右。这时，逻辑思维出现了，但孩子们仍然在抽象和理论思维中挣扎。

(4) [The formal operational stage](https://www.verywellmind.com/formal-operational-stage-of-cognitive-development-2795459): In the fourth and final stage of cognitive development, lasting from age 12 and into adulthood, children become much more adept at abstract thought and deductive reasoning.

正式的操作阶段: 在认知发展的第四个也是最后一个阶段，从12岁持续到成年，儿童变得更善于抽象思维和演绎推理。

Piaget's Contributions to Psychology 皮亚杰对心理学的贡献
-----------------------------------------------

Piaget provided support for the idea that children think differently than adults and his research identified several important milestones in the mental development of children. His work also generated interest in cognitive and developmental psychology.

皮亚杰为儿童与成人的思维方式不同这一观点提供了支持，他的研究确定了儿童智力发展的几个重要里程碑。他的工作也引起了人们对认知和发展心理学的兴趣。

Piaget's theories are widely studied today by students of both psychology and education. In the case of the latter, he once said, "The principle goal of education in the schools should be creating men and women who are capable of doing new things, not simply repeating what other generations have done."5

皮亚杰的理论今天被心理学和教育学的学生广泛研究。就后者而言，他曾经说过,”学校教育的主要目标应该是培养有能力做新事情的人，而不是简单地重复其他几代人的做法。“5

Piaget also held many chair positions throughout his career and conducted research in psychology and epistemology. He created the International Center for Genetic Epistemology in 1955 and served as its director until his death on September 16, 1980.

皮亚杰在其整个职业生涯中也担任过许多主席职务，并对心理学和认识论进行了研究。他于1955年创建了国际发生认识论中心，并担任该中心主任，直到1980年9月16日去世。

Piaget's Influence on Psychology 皮亚杰对心理学的影响
-------------------------------------------

Piaget's theories continue to be studied in the areas of psychology, sociology, education, and genetics. His work contributed to our understanding of the cognitive development of children. While earlier researchers had often viewed children simply as smaller versions of adults, Piaget helped demonstrate that childhood is a unique and important period of human development.

皮亚杰的理论继续在心理学、社会学、教育学和遗传学等领域进行研究。他的工作有助于我们理解儿童的认知发展。虽然早期的研究人员通常认为儿童只是成年人的缩小版，但皮亚杰帮助证明了童年是人类发展的一个独特而重要的时期。

His work also influenced other notable psychologists including [Howard Gardner](https://www.verywellmind.com/howard-gardner-biography-2795511) and [Robert Sternberg](https://www.verywellmind.com/robert-sternberg-biography-1949-2795530). In their 2005 text, _The Science of False Memory_, authors C.J. Brainerd and V.F. Reyna wrote of Piaget's influence:

他的工作也影响了其他著名的心理学家，包括 Howard Gardner 和罗伯特·史坦伯格。在他们2005年的文章《错误记忆的科学》中，作者 c.j. Brainerd 和 v.f. Reyna 写到皮亚杰的影响:

"In the course of a long and hugely prolific career, he contributed important scholarly work to fields as diverse as the philosophy of science, linguistics, education, sociology, and evolutionary biology. Above all, however, he was _the_ developmental psychologist of the 20th century.

“在漫长而多产的职业生涯中，他为科学哲学、语言学、教育学、社会学和进化生物学等多个领域做出了重要的学术贡献。然而，最重要的是，他是20世纪的发展心理学家。

For two decades, from the early 1960s to the early 1980s, Piagetian theory and Piaget's research findings dominated developmental psychology worldwide, much as Freud's ideas had dominated abnormal psychology a generation before. Almost single-handedly, he shifted the focus of developmental research away from its traditional concerns with social and emotional development and toward cognitive development."6

从20世纪60年代早期到80年代早期，皮亚杰理论和皮亚杰的研究成果在20世纪发展心理学占据了主导地位，就像弗洛伊德的思想在一代人之前主导了异常心理学一样。他几乎是单枪匹马地将发展研究的重点从传统的关注社会和情感发展转向认知发展。“6

A Word From Verywell 来自 Verywell 的一句话
-------------------------------------

Jean Piaget helped shape our foundational knowledge of childhood cognitive development. His theories have influenced not just the field of developmental psychology, but also other fields, including sociology, education, and more.

He is also known for creating the term "genetic epistemology," which refers to the study of knowledge development.7
    
    皮亚杰因他的认知发展理论而闻名，该理论首次提出了儿童的思维方式与成人不同的概念，这在当时是一种新的思维方式。他还创造了“发生认识论”这个术语，指的是知识发展的研究
    
*   It is during the preoperational stage that children begin to develop language according to Piaget's theory. This is the second stage of development and begins when the child is around 2 years of age and lasts until they are roughly 7.
    
    根据皮亚杰的理论，儿童是在手术前阶段开始发展语言的。这是发展的第二阶段，从孩子2岁左右开始，一直持续到大约7岁。
    
*   Piaget defined egocentrism as a mindset that "vivifies the external world and materialises the internal world."8 Put simply, it is having a greater focus on one's own thoughts and feelings than on the thoughts and feelings of others. Piaget theorized that egocentrism developed between the stages of autistic thought (thought that is undirected and symbolic) and scientific thought (thought that is more logical and socialized)—which is roughly between the ages of 3 and 7.8
    
    皮亚杰将自我中心主义定义为“使外部世界生动起来，使内部世界物化”的心态。“8简单地说，就是更多地关注自己的想法和感受，而不是他人的想法和感受。皮亚杰的理论认为，自我中心主义是在自闭症思维(思维是无向的和象征性的)和科学思维(思维更具逻辑性和社会化的)之间发展起来的，大约在3岁到7.8岁之间
    
*   Piaget's cognitive development theory changed the way we look at child development—namely, that children have different thought processes than adults. His contributions greatly influenced future developmental theories within the psychology field while also impacting other fields as well, such as education, sociology, and genetics.
    
    皮亚杰的认知发展理论改变了我们看待儿童发展的方式，也就是说，儿童的思维过程与成人不同。他的贡献极大地影响了未来心理学领域的发展理论，同时也影响了其他领域，如教育学、社会学和遗传学。
